# Approximate Nearest Neighbour Counting with Differential Privacy

This project aims to implement the algorithms in the paper *Aum√ºller, Martin, Fabrizio Boninsegna, and Francesco Silvestri. "A Simple Linear Space Data Structure for ANN with Application in Differential Privacy." arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.07187 (2024).*

The project is still under development.
